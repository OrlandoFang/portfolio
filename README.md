### About Me
I am a UMich-Ann Arbor undergraduate Junior. My intended major is Computer Science. I am passionate about coding, problem-solving, software engineering, and building innovative prediction models and data visualizations.

### Projects
#### [Exploratory Data Analysis On Professional League of Legends Matches (Python)](https://orlandofang.github.io/most-exciting-league-in-league-of-legends/)
The project aims to analyze League of Legends Competitive Matches in 2022. Data obtained from Oracle’s Elixir. The dataset contains over 10,000 League of Legends competitive matches. The analysis will utilize the dataset and answer the following questions: Looking at tier-one professional leagues, which league has the most “action-packed” games? Is the amount of “action” in this league significantly different than in other leagues?
Steps include Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Assessment of Missingness, and Hypothesis Testing.

#### [Prediction Model On Professional League of Legends Matches (Python)](https://orlandofang.github.io/league-of-legends-role-prediction/)
I used the 2022 League of Legends Professional Matches dataset to create a prediction model that predicts the roles of individual players given their post-game data. In the project, I describe my process of improving my base model until I reached a final model with a 96.2% accuracy on unseen data. In the end, I also performed a Fairness Analysis.

#### [Data Visualizations on Factors Affecting Flight Delays (HTML, CSS, JS)](https://orlandofang.github.io/Flight_Delays/)
The project aims to analyze how various factors can affect the possibility of encountering flight delays in the US, and find the best airline, airport, and state for flights. I used common data visualizations so that the general audience, flight passengers, could understand my analysis without much knowledge of the topic. I also embedded data interactivity in three of the visualizations.
Note that this webpage can take around half a minute to load the visualizations because it processes more than 5 million rows of data.
