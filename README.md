# Tianrui (Orlando) Fang
UC San Diego Undergraduate Major in Data Science
### About Me
I am a UCSD Junior-Standing undergraduate majoring in Data Science and minoring in Economics. I am passionate about coding, problem-solving, and building innovative prediction models and data visualizations.

### Projects
#### [Project 1](https://orlandofang.github.io/most-exciting-league-in-league-of-legends/)
The project aims to analyze League of Legends Competitive Matches in 2022. Data obtained from Oracle’s Elixir. The dataset contains over 10,000 League of Legends competitive matches. The analysis will utilize the dataset and answer the following questions: Looking at tier-one professional leagues, which league has the most “action-packed” games? Is the amount of “action” in this league significantly different than in other leagues?
Steps include Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Assessment of Missingness, and Hypothesis Testing.

#### [Project 2](https://orlandofang.github.io/league-of-legends-role-prediction/)
I used the same dataset in Project 1 to create a prediction model that predicts the roles of individual players given their post-game data. In the project, I describe my process of improving my base model until I reached a final model with a 96.2% accuracy on unseen data. In the end, I also performed a Fairness Analysis.

#### [Project 3](https://orlandofang.github.io/Flight_Delays/)
The project aims to analyze how various factors can affect the possibility of encountering flight delays in the US, and find the best airline, airport, and state for flights. I used common data visualizations so that the general audience, flight passengers, can understand my analysis without much knowledge of the topic. I also embedded data interactivity in three of the visualizations.
Note that this webpage can take around half a minute to load the visualizations because it processes more than 5 million rows of data.
